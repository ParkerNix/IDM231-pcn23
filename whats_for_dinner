  <h1>What Should You REALLY Eat For Dinner?</h1>
  <p>Enter Birthday Here:</p>
  <p>You Got:</p>
  <h2>FAST Food</h2>
  <h2>Your Own Cooking</h2>
  <h2>Two Very Different Meals</h2>
  <h2>NOT The Resturant From That One Time</h2>
  <h2>A Feast Fit For The Queen You Are</h2>
  <h2>Perfection on a Plate</h2>
  <h2>Literally Nothing</h2>
  <h2>The Usual Place That You Love</h2>
  <h2>Something Weird and Not Appealing</h2>
  <h2>Something You Secretly Love</h2>
  <h2>A Thing Only You Could Think Of</h2>
  <h2>Whatever Everyone Else Wants</h2>
  <p>Whatever it is, it better be here within the next five seconds.<br>
    Waiting will not be on the menu tonight, so move it or else.</p>
    <p>Why leave to get something? You can make it right from home!<br>
        So what if it's not fancy? You're crafty (and too lazy to go out)!</p>
    <p>Well, there was that one place, and the other place, and you<br>
        couldn't quite pick, so... More for you!</p>
    <p>Alright, we know the rant is coming, just let it out.<br>
        At least we know what to look for this time (and what to avoid...)</p>
    <p>Extra does not even begin to describe the lavish dinner you want.<br>
        You have to treat yourself every now and again, right?</p>
    <p>Okay, if there is so much as a noodle, pepperoni, a carrot out of place,<br>
        Consider this "dinner" cancelled. Point blank period.</p>
    <p>Just choose anything at this point, actually anything.<br>
        You're going to starve before you ever even order.</p>
    <p>Gotta show some love to the classics, couldn't live without 'em.<br>
        The thought of betraying them? You could never.</p>
    <p>Where others would totally run and scream for someone to burn it,<br>
        you proudly sit down, ready to dig in. Bravery at its finest.</p>
    <p>Absolutely NO ONE can ever know that you love to eat this,<br>
        but you could never just pass up an oppportunity to get some!</p>
    <p>Step one: pull a bunch of random stuff from the pantry.<br>
        Step two: put 'em together and see what happens.</p>
    <p>You don't want to be pushy, so you go with the popular choice.<br>
        Curry? Sounds good. Ramen? Sure! Crickets? Maybe not everything...</p>
